        </h1>
        <p>
          I help startups and companies navigate uncertainty by building design where nothing exists yet — from concept and presale to a working, scalable product.
        </p>
        <p>
          My work bridges strategy and execution, giving shape to ideas that don't yet have form.
        </p>
        <p>
          Setting up design operations, workflows, and frameworks that help teams run efficiently and grow sustainably. I align design with business goals, optimize costs and decision-making, and lead teams through the messy early stages of growth until structure and clarity take over.
